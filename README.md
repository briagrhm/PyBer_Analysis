Summary 
The analysis for PyBer shows that the most money is made in the urban cities. However with to many drivers the amount of money to be made decreases. It may be wise to keep an eye on the driver count, with more drivers than rides this could lead to a problem for the drivers not making enough income. Rural cities make the least amount of money, it seems there are less customers there so worrying about adding more drivers should not be a problem. Suburban cities  seem to be in the middle of both rural and urban cities. There doesnt seem to be an issue with the amount of drivers in that area, but making sure to keep an eye on drivers and total rides is important to keep it that way.
